## Approach
As the challenge suggests the use of ROT encoding, our first step is to decode the given text. You can either:
- Use an online decoder, such as CyberChef.
- Write your own decoding script, using programming languages like Python.
  
To decode the given ROT13 text, I used CyberChef, a popular online tool for data manipulation. CyberChef simplifies ROT13 decoding with its built-in "ROT13" recipe.
- Input the ROT13 string: Paste the encoded text from the challenge into CyberChef.
- Apply the ROT13 recipe: Use the ROT13 decoder to transform the input into readable text.
