> Netcat, often called the "Swiss Army knife" for TCP/IP, is a versatile networking tool available on most Linux systems. It is used for:
> - Sending and receiving data across network connections.
> - Debugging and testing network services.
> - Port scanning and network diagnostics.
> - Simple file transfers and chat setups.

> In this challenge, Netcat is used to connect to a remote server and retrieve the flag by interacting with it over a specified port (3003).
