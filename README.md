# SKRCTF Writeups - Unveiling My Journey! ðŸŽ‰

My approach to the SKRCTF revolves around three key goals:
* **Learn**: Each challenge provides a valuable chance to learn new cybersecurity skills, tools, or ideas.
* **Collaborate**: I enjoy working with other participants to share ideas and knowledge, which makes the learning experience better for everyone.
* **Document**: For every challenge I solve, I will try write up a detailed explanation. These documents help others learn from my experience and also help me to better understand the concepts myself.
* **Challenge**: I will seek out more challenging tasks within the CTF to gain more confidence and expertise
